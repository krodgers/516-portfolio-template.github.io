# Project 1: Portfolio Website

# Instructions

Follow the instructions located at [Project 1 Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eVn6E6E7UcjRDseMgza0FBvWw-593y7K0NkI6SV6Mqo/edit?usp=sharing) to create a portfolio website.

# Deploying

To view your website, open your repository in a web browser (you can
always use the link on Canvas that you used to accept the assignment).  Go to "Settings" (right after Insights at the very top of the page).  Choose "Pages" from the menu on the left.

The first time you deploy your website, you'll need to choose a branch
from which to ddeploy.  Under "Build and deployment", choose the
*main* branch from the dropdown menu.  You'll have to wait a few
minutes while the website deploys.

After your site has been successfully deployed, there will be a link
at the top of the "Pages" page.  It will say "Your site is live at <
some url >".  That URL is a publically accessible URL.  If you share
it, anyone can see your website!

You can also bookmark or otherwise save this URL so you can access it
directly instead of having to go to Settings - Pages everytime you
want to see your website.

# Submitting

To submit, make sure all of your source files (.html, .css, .js) have
been added and committed to your repository.  If your website looks
like you expect, everything has probably been added.  And that's it!
You don't need to submit anything else anywhere else.

Whatever is in your repository when the project is due is what I will
grade.
